    <p>With over 10 years of experience working in the field doing <em>Data Entry, Medical Asisting and Pharmacy</em>, 
        I have developed excellent adaptability to different work enviroments and the ethical skills to provide quality services to others.
    Because of the Covid-19 I decided to leave the medical field behind because of the dangers it exposed not only myself but those closest to me.
It was then when I found my true passion, computer science and me just clicked. I could continue to help others in a miningful way,
while also being part of this amazing world of software development.
Applying the same learning ethics of the medical field I decide to study every major component of software development, working with differnt computer languages and programs like:
<strong>SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, Java, C++, R</strong>and<strong>AWS</strong>. Becoming a full stack developer in the process. But decided to specialize in areas such as <em>Analisys</em>
 and <em>Cybersecurity</em>. </p>
